# README #

This README provides information my experiences with React Native framework. Please be aware that I have limited experience with it, but I was able to 
form some king of opinion about it.

## The positives
* You can make new project entirely in react native but also individual screens or flows (I did not try that out yet).
* Framework is very similar to Vue.js, Angular 1 and it easy to pick up React Native if you know any of those frameworks. Concepts are the same.
* Modularization of code is very simple and intuitive. You achieve it by nesting custom components from more general to detailed.
* Simplified lifecycle - updating screen after network response is as easy as assigning variable.
* Community is big (stackoverflow, github), documentation is ok
* Lots of plugins etc.
* Lots of tutorials and articles both free and paid

## The negatives
* plugins often dont work e.g. "renaming project plugin"
* Often exceptions that are thrown do not say anything about the error and are very general. You need to debug by commenting out code and restarting. It reminded me of PHP which I dislike.
* Not a lot of tools, you are still using Atom with some simple plugins like eslint, but forget about some advanced features that are in Android Studio. Xcode users probably are not going to notice this though:-)
